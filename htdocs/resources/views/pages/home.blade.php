		<h1>What We Do</h1>
		<div class='content left'>
			<h3>Hack Nights</h3>
			<p>
				Every fortnight, Purdue Hackers hosts Hack Nights at the Anvil.
				Bring any personal projects, ideas, or friends to build and learn
				about cool up and coming technologies. Hack nights are also a great
				place to meet other hackers in the community and meet some of the
				students at the forefront of innovation at Purdue. On occasion,
				we will also invite speakers from cutting edge companies in the
				industry as well.
			<p>
			<h3>Ignite</h3>
			<p>
				Ignite is a one on one coding bootcamp ran in the fall by the
				Purdue Hackers team. Incoming freshmen are each paired with an
				upperclassman mentor and over the course of the semester, is guided
				through the process of creating an awesome technical project.
				Socials are held for the pairs and demos are shown off at the end
				of the semester. Apply today at <a href="//ignitethefla.me">IgniteTheFla.me</a>.
			</p>
			<h3>Hackathons</h3>
			<p>
				The fastest way to build the project of your dreams with your
				closest buds. Hackthons are 36 hour coding competitions that take
				place all across the country. Get to know representatives from
				companies like Google, Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, and many more!
				Plus, each event is filled to the brim with free food and free swag.

		<h1>FAQ</h1>
		<div class='faq-img'></div>
		<div class='content right'>
			<h3>What is hacking?</h3>
			<p>
				Unlike the TV shows and movies, hacking isn&#39;t about breaking
				into systems and stealing information. For us, to hack is to create
				innovative projects using technology as a means.
			<p>
			<h3>I missed the callout!<br>Can I still join?</h3>
			<p>
				Of course! You can find all of our events in the Purdue Hackers
				facebook group. We also have Recursions at the Anvil every other
				week. No prior knowledge or experience needed; just a excited and
				ready to learn attitude.
			</p>
			<h3>Can I join even if I can&#39;t code?</h3>
			<p>
				You bet you can! So long as you&#39;re passionate about how
				technology can shape the future, you&#39;ll fit right in. We also
				offer Ignite, a coding bootcamp every semester, that takes you from
				zero to hero in just a couple weeks.
			</p>
			<h3>What does the logo mean?</h3>
			<p>
				It&#39;s a glider from Conway&#39;s Game of Life. It&#39;s a
				universal symbol for hacking and was chosen because it&#39;s the
				only pattern in the game that can spread life to different colonies.
